### About Me
Software Engineer (former Technical Integration Engineer) leveraging business education and experience combined with technical skills to build asynchronous telehealth into Evernorth's primary and urgent care offerings. Graduated with honors from the Master of Science in Entrepreneurship program at the University of Washington before launching my first startup, Lonely Produce. Enriched my coding knowledge through a full-stack web development certificate program at the University of Washington. I pick up new concepts quickly and use my strategic thinking skills to keep projects focused on solving the customerâ€™s problem. Coming from a family of developers, I spent a long time trying to break the mold before realizing that coding is in my blood. I truly love the precise, tangibly logical nature of software. I am proud to use my passion for problem-solving while building the next big thing in telehealth at Evernorth. 

In my free time, I can be found hiking, playing board games, cooking, and jamming on new startup ideas.
