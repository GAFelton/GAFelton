### About Me
I am a full-stack web developer combining business education and experience with technical web development skills to build powerful, user-focused web-apps. Graduated with honors from the Master of Science in Entrepreneurship program at the University of Washington before launching my first startup, Lonely Produce. Now pursuing a certificate in full-stack web development from the University of Washington, utilizing primarily Javascript for both front-end and back-end programming. I pick up new concepts quickly and use my strategic thinking skills to keep projects focused on solving the customerâ€™s problem. Coming from a family of developers, I spent a long time trying to break the mold before realizing that writing code is in my blood. I truly love the precise, tangibly logical nature of software development. I look forward to bringing my business sense and passion for problem-solving to bear in building the next big thing.

In my free time, I can be found hiking, playing board games, cooking, and jamming on new startup ideas.
